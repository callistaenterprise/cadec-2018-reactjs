              "With the advent of libraries like React, Redux and Immutable.js, it's clear that there's a shift away from imperative and object-oriented in the front-end towards a more declarative and functional approach. Meanwhile, libraries like RxJS and Mobx are spreading the use of Reactive Programming to model UIs via discrete, asynchronous event streams. How can we combine the best of both functional and reactive paradigms to model and build predictable UIs that control themselves?\n\nIn this talk, Preethi will explain what “Functional Reactive Programming” is, how close React / Redux / Mobx / RxJs and others come in realizing Functional Reactive Programming, and what's still fundamentally missing from these tools to achieve a true implementation of FRP. Lastly, she'll describe when and why  FRP is suitable (or not suitable) for building predictable and scalable UIs.",

              "We are biologically trained to notice motion: evolutionarily speaking, our survival depends on it. For this reason, animation when done well can guide your users. It can aid and reinforce spatial maps of our interfaces, and give us a sense that we understand interactions more deeply. For this reason, animation is incredibly powerful to convey meaning, but only when done well.\n\nBut animating the virtual DOM comes with some intricacies that affect our implementations. In this talk, we'll go over animating in React with a variety of methods, comparing and contrasting each. We'll cover add-ons like ReactCSSTransitionGroup, using external libraries like GSAP, React-Motion, motion using RxJS, and transitioning state with D3. We'll look inside some real systems, breaking down how we can create reusable components of animation principles for interchangeable yet cohesive patterns.",

We start by modelling our state after the mental picture we have from the problem. After that we define the operations we want to perform on the state, and define which information we want to derive from the state.\nWe will start small, and then discover that the very same principles apply to rendering our UI (using react), authentication, routing, testing, async processes. After this workshop you should have gathered enough knowledge to build real life applications based on MobX and the underlying reactive principles.\n\nTopics:\n\n* Introduction.\n* Setup\n* ES6 / ES.Next recap: arrow functions, classes, decorators, field initializers\n* Introduction to MobX, why MobX for state management?\n* MobX basics: observable, computed, autorun & action\n* Modelling domain state: stores, models, actions\n* Testing state & logic, JEST, snapshots\n* Building reactive user interface: observer (+ testing)\n* Recap: How does MobX track changes?\n* Using Provider / inject to pass stores through deeply nested interfaces\n* Fetching & storing data (+ testing)\n* Routing & authentication\n* Form validations\n* Conclusion",

If your screens are built with sufficient isolation, they can be portable between apps, platforms, and navigation implementations. In this talk, we will discuss how this ultimate modularity can be achieved simply by utilizing reducers and single-directional data flow. Then we will use React Navigation to quickly build a new experience with these techniques, and see how portable it really is.",
